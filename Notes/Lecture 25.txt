Queueing Network Simulations
	-Queues make economic sense, keep you resources at a high utilization (i.e. don't have checkouts open that aren't used)
	-Balance between customer service and resource utilization
	
	Modeling
		-There are Jobs
		-Jobs enter queue
		-queues feed into servers
		-jobs are processed
		
	Arrival Process
		-How to jobs arrive
			-Batches (i.e. a large group that appears at once?)
			-Distributed in time (for individually appearing jobs)
				-Do they appear uniformly, or randomly
				-(i.e. Cars entering a highway)
				Inter-arrival Time Distribution
				
			-Typically modeled by the Poisson Process
				-Random, but exponentially distributed
	Service Mechanism
		-How long
			-Service Time Distribution
				-Speed of Servers
					-Fast Cashier or slow Cashier
				-Length of job processing
					-Small Basket vs two full carts.
			-#Number of Servers
			-Number of Queues
			-Allow Premption (Can a server pause a job, and serve another job)
			
	Queue Characteristics (discipline)
		-Policy (How to choose next job)
			-Fifo
			-Lifo
			-SRPT (Shortest Remaining Processing Time)
				i.e. take the fastest first
				
	Questions a model can answer
	Avg waiting time?
	Is waiting time bounded?
	Avg Queue Length?
	Bound on Queue Length?
	Server Utilization?
	
	Fairness
		-SRPT allows starvation
		-Long jobs would never get processed if small jobs kept arriving
		
Pseudo Code

Create Stops and Initialize
	While time not expired
		move bus
		passengers arrive
		when bus at stop
			unload
			load
