How many samples do we need to believe the answer?

Variance
	-Measure of how much spread there is in possible outcomes
		
Standard Deviation
	-The fraction of values that are close to the mean.
	std(X) = ((1/|num trials in X|) * Sum((x - mu) ^ 2))^(1/2) where X is the set of trials, x is the value of a trial,  and mu is the mean.
	
Coefficient of Variation
	-Standard Deviation / Mean
	-If <1, low variance
	-Cannot be used for confidence intervals 
	
Confidence Interval 
	-Range likely to contain unknown value and confidence level that values lies within range
	
Standard Error
	p = % Sampled
	n = sample size
	se = ((p*(100-p)/n)) ** .5
	
Normal Distribution
	-Peaks at mean
	-Fall off symmetrically
	-Also know as a "Bell Curve"
	
	-Commonly used to construct probabilistic models for two reasons
		1) Nice mathematical properties
			-Can be characterized solely by mean and standard deviation
			-Mean and standard deviation can be used to construct confidence intervals
		2) Many naturally occurring examples
		
	-Empirical Rule
		-68% of the data is within 	1 sd of mean
		-95% 								2 sd 
		-99.7%								3 sd
