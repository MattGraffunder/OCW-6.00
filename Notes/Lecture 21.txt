Graph Theory

Graph
	-Set of Nodes (Vertices)
	-Connected by set of edges (arcs)
	
If edges are unidirectional, graph is called digraph or directed graph

Edges have weights

Structure of Graphs
	-Adjacency Matrix (N x N)
		-Represented as an N x N array
		-Doesn't handle multiple edges 
	-Adjacency List
		-Represented by listing all edges eminating from that node
