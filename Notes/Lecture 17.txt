Before believing that our result is correct we have to have confidence that our conceptual model is correct and that we implemented it correctly.

Hooke's Law
	f = -kx where k is the spring constant
	
Finding the best fit of a curve
	-Least Squares Fit
		- Sum((Observed[i]-Predicted[i]) ** 2) where observed is the data point at a position i, and predicted is the curve
		
Polyfit - Used to find a well fit curve
	-polyfit(obsX, obsY, degree of polynomial)
	-Uses Linear Regression
	
Coefficient of Determination (R ** 2)
	(R ** 2) = 1 - (EE/MV) 
	Where EE is the Estimated Error
	and MV is the Variance in the Measured Data
