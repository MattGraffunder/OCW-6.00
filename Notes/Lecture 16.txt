Computational Models

Non-Gaussian Distributions

Uniform Distribution
	-Each Result is equally probably (i.e. rolling a dice)
	-Can be characterized only by the range
	
Exponential Distribution
	-Memoryless ( The likely hood of something happening doesn't increase with time, i.e. a drug half-life)
	-Only continuous distribution that is memoryless
	-Probability something remaining is (1-p) ^ t, where p is the probability and t is the time step
	
Analytic Models
	
Simulation Model

Two main concerns for models
	-Fidelity (i.e. Credibility)
	-Utility (What questions are answerable)
	
Using Randomness to Solve Non-Random Problems
	-Solving difficult analytical problems can be aided by using randomness
	-Such as computing the value of pi to some level of precision.
