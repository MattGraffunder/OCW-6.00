Divide and Conquer
	-Divide into smaller problems with two properties
		-Small problems are easier to solve
		-Solutions to small problems can easily be recombined into a solution for the original problems
		
Recursion
	-Way of describing problems
	-Way of designing solutions
	
	-Base Case
		-Provides direct answer
	-Inductive Case
		-Reduce to a simpler version of the same problem
