Shortest Path Problem
	-Fewest Edges
	
Shortest Weighted Path
	-Find the path with the smallest weight, even if more edges
	
Find Cliques
	-Find set of nodes such that there exists a path connecting each node in the set
	
Minimum Cut Problem (min cut)
	-Given two sets of nodes, find the minimum number of edges such that if removed, the two sets are disconnected
	-I.e. how many powerlines would need to be cut in a network to cut off a city
	
Shortest Path Problem
	-Recursive Depth First Search (DFS)
		-Recursion Ends when Start = Ends
		-Starts by choosing one child of current node
			-Continues until reaching a node with no children, the node we're looking for, or a visited node
			
Memoization
	-Table look up
	-At the heart of dynamic programming
	
Dynamic Programming
	-Used to solve exponential problems in less then exponential time
	-Requires two properties
		-Optimal Substructure
			-Can find globally optimal solution by combining locally optimal solutions
		-Overlapping Sub-problems
			-If there isn't any overlap, then memoization won't yield any speedup
