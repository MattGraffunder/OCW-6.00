Causal Non-determinism
	-Belief that not every event was caused by a previous event
	
Predictive Non-determinism
	-The inability to make accurate measurements of the word makes it impossible to make predictions
	
Stochastic Processes
	-A process is stochastic if its next state depends on both its previous state and some random element
	-Two events are independent if the outcome of one event has no influence on the outcome of another
	
random.choice
	-Chooses an element from a list
	-Implemented with random.random
		-Generates a random float greater than 0, but not greater than 1
		
Data Visualization
	-PyLab
		-provides many of the facilities of MATLAB
		-PyLab.Show should be used once, and only at the end.
