Computational Thinking: The Process
	-Identify or invent useful abstractions
	-Formulate solution to a problem as a computational experiment
	-Design and construct a sufficiently efficient implementation of experiment
	-Validate experimental setup (i.e. debugging)
	-Run experiment
	-Evaluate results of experiment
	-Repeat as needed
	
Two A's of computational thinkings
	-Abstraction
		-Choosing the right abstractions
		-Operating in terms of multiple layers of abstractions
		-Defining the relationships between the layers
	-Automation
		-Thinking in terms of mechanizing our abstractions
		-Mechanization is possible
			-Because we have precise and exacting notations and models (programming languages)
			-There is a "machine" that can interpret our notation (i.e. python interpreter)
