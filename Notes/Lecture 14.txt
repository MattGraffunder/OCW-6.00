Randomness in problem solving

Monte Carlo Simulation
	-Solving a probabilistic system using simulation rather than analytically solving equations
	-Inferential Statistics
		-A random sample tends to exhibt the same properties as the the population from which it is drawn
		
	Null Hypothesis 
		-What you would get with a random event
		
Law of Large Numbers 
	-Also known as Bernoulli's Law
	-In repeated independent tests with the same actual probablility, P, 
		chance that the fraction of times that outcome occurs converges to P as the number of trials goes to infinity
