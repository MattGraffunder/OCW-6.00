Generator:
	-yield keyword
	-Is a function that rembers the point in the function body where it last returned, plus the local variables
	-Allows you to control access to the list such that you could return a sub-set or other computed result
	
Analytic Methods
	-Predict behavior given intial conditions and some parameters
	-i.e. Newtonian Physics
	
Simulation Methods
	-An estimation of what might happen to a system under certain condition and repeating that multiple time for slightly different conditions
	-Systems that aren't mathematically tractable
	-i.e. Weather Forecasting
	-Successively refining series of simulations
	-Useful to extract intermediate results
	
	-Build a model
		-Gives useful information about behavior of a system
		-Approximation to reality
		Simulation models are descriptive, not prescriptive
		
Brownian Motion
	-Example of a "Randow Walk"
	
Model
	-Need a Drunk
	-Need a Field
	-Need a Location
