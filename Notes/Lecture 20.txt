Feature Vector
	-Scale Elements of the Vectors
		i.e. a vector of distance and temp
	-Feature Selection and Scaling is Critical
		-Done using domain knowledge
		
Minkowski Metric
	-Method for measuring the distance between two vectors
	
Nominal Categories
	-i.e. Eye color
	-Convert to a number, requires domain knowledge
	
k-means clustering
	1) Choose k (number of final clusters)
	2) Choose k points for intial centroids
		-Often chosen at random
	3) Assign each point to a cluster
		-Not likely to produce anything meaningful
	4) Choose new centroid for each cluster
	5) Assign each pt to new cluster
	6) Repeat 4 & 5 until change is small
