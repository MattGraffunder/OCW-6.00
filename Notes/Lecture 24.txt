Statiscal Measures don't tell the whole story
	- Look at the data
	
Pictures can be deceiving

Garbage In Garbage Out - GIGO

Cum Hoc Ergo Propter hoc Fallacy
	-Correlation doesn't imply causation
	-Lurking Variable
		-A underlying piece of information that is related to two correlated sets of data but not seen from the statistics
		
Non-response bias
	Using a sample and ignoring those that didn't respond (i.e. a census) and assuming that the sample is still random.

Non-representative sample

Convenience Sampling
	-Using the population available instead of a random sample, and assuming the available sample is representative
	
Data Enhancement
	-Over emphasising data when compared to its larger context.	
		-i.e. swine flu being attributed to 159 deaths in a period of time, but the conventional flu being attributed to 36,000 annually.
		
	-Extrapolating data
		-i.e. projecting 120% of people will be using the internet from a charting showing linear growth of internet service over a period of 5 years.
		
Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy
	-Forming a hypothesis after reviewing the data.
		-i.e. stating that there are more anorexics born in june than other months when the month was chosen after the data was seen
			-Therefore not accounting for the probability that more anorexics could have been born in another month by random chance.
