	-Machine that performs one type of computation

Stored Program Computer
	-Algorithm is considered data
	
Interpreter
	-Program that can execute any legal instruction set
	
Turing Completeness
	-Six Primitive Single Bit Instructions

	-Static Semantics
		--Tells us which strings have meaning
	-Semantics
