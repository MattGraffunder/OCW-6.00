Floating Point Numbers
	-Difficult to represent correctly in Binary
	-Usually just get within a certain tolerance, and call them equal
	-Do not compare equality of floats
	
Goal of Debugging
	-Not to eliminate one bug quickly
	-It is to move towards a bug free program
	
Techniques
	-Ask How could it have produced the result it did.
	-Steps:
		-Study Available Data:
			-Program Text
			-Test Results
		-Form Hypothesis Consistant with Data
		-Design and run repeatable expirement
			-Must have potential to refute the hypothesis
	
	-Find small input on which program fails
	-There is no such thing as fixing the bug, there is only fixing a bug.
