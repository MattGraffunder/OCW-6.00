Problem 1
	- Error decreases from the training set as the number of clusters decreases
	- Holdout error seems to be too low.

	- The holdout error decreases slowly because it should be close to the average error of each training point to the training cluster.


Problem 2
	-Yes, Hennipen clusters with the same counties
	-Run produced an avg occurance of 2.7 times
	-Counties seem similare in housing prices, and income.
