Problem 1
	- Error decreases from the training set as the number of clusters decreases
	- Holdout error seems to be too low.

	- The holdout error decreases slowly because it should be close to the average error of each training point to the training cluster.


Problem 2
	-Yes, Hennipen clusters with the same counties
	-Run produced an avg occurance of 2.7 times
	-Counties seem similare in housing prices, and income.

Problem 3
	-Error is lower for smaller k.  I would imagine this is because the clusters with a lot of points would have an avg poverty close to the avg of the dataset.
		As the clusters get more focused, the factors that don't impact poverty get more weight and the avg poverty gets further from the predicted point.

Problem 4
	- I found that for a vector of [Income, HS Grads, College Grads, and Unemployed] produced a more consistant result.  
		This is likely because areas with a better educated population likely have more stable incomes.
