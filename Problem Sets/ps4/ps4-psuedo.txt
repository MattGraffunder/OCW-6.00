Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:

set maxWords and bestShift to 0

for each shift:
	decode string
	split string into word list on "SPACE"
	
	check each word for validity
	
	if there are more valid words than maxWords:
		set maxWords to validWords
		set bestShift to shift
		
return bestShift
