Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:

set maxWords and bestShift to 0

for each shift:
	decode string
	split string into word list on "SPACE"
	
	check each word for validity
	
	if there are more valid words than maxWords:
		set maxWords to validWords
		set bestShift to shift
		
return bestShift

Write out your algorithm for Problem 4 here:

	loop through shifts
		decode string from start using shift
		split on "SPACE"
		while word is valid:
			move index forward
			
		if one or more word is valid
			get shifts for remaining string
			
			if remaining shifts is None
				continue checking other shifts
			else
				return shift + remainingShifts
		
Base Case: There is one valid word
Inductive Case: There is one valid word, and invalid words
